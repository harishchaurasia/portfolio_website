          Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Harish Chaurasia, a Computer Science major passionate about Development, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning.
          I'm pursuing minors in Music and Entrepreneurship, and a Certification in Game Development. This blend of technical and creative skills 
          enhances my problem-solving abilities. As a Software and Games Developer at the School of Manufacturing Systems and Networks, I work on 
          a project with Los Alamos National Laboratory, honing my software development and project management skills. As President of Devil's 
          DJing Club at ASU, I organize music events. I've also been the Outreach Officer at the Google Developer Student Club and conducted 
          research at ASU's Laboratory for Energy and Power Solutions. Let's collaborate to turn challenges into innovative solutions!
